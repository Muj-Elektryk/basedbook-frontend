# Why BasedBook?
## Modular design
Our social platform is designed to be modular. Backend API is separated from frontend, which means if you don't like our UI, you can always write your own frontend in your favourite framework.

## Popular technologies
Everyone knows that daily rises thousands of JavaScript frameworks, but there are some very popular projects.
React and TypeScript are ones of them and we use them.

## BasedBook ties your local communities together
BasedBook lets you share your ideas and projects with other people in your school, village, town or city.
