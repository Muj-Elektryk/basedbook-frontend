# Muj Elektryk - Frontend

This is frontend of our powerful application.

## Build
That's important to clone submodules, because we embed matrix client via one.
We suggest to clone our repository with all submodules right away:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Muj-Elektryk/muj-elektryk-frontend/
```

but if you have already cloned our repository run this:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Now it's time to build this monster. 
All you need is to install all dependencies (we use pure npm) and start it:
```
npm i
npm start
```
