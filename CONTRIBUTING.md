# ☭ WE NEED YOUR HELP ☭
Our project needs a lot of developers to bring it alive!

## How?

### Issues
First of all, you need to find an issue that you want to fix. If there is no one you can create a new one. 
Without reference to issues your code is in danger of being rejected. 

### Coding
We are going to create a documentation of that basedbook server. Every next commit should take part in it.
In order to do that, check out (typedoc)[https://typedoc.org/guides/overview/].

### Testing
It's common to 'generate' some errors when coding. 
Our project uses CI so make sure your code doesn't not blow all workflows up.

### Pull request
When we want you to do something, please do not hate us. We really don't have
sex with our mothers.
